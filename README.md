## Moka (Mosquito) Attack!
The game is broken into a building phase and a simulation phase. The building phase begins with a short introduction and a
bird's-eye view of a neighborhood. Their otherwise pleasant town has one major issue, malaria. The player's job as mayor is to
spend their resources wisely on prevention methods to stop the spread of malaria. When the building phase is over the town
darkens as night approaches and the buzz of mosquitoes are heard. This begins the simulation phase, which analyzes the
effectiveness of the prevention methods used verses simulated mosquitoes. During this phase targeted messages are directed at the
player as major events occur in the simulation. For instance, when the first resident contracts malaria a message will pop up
explaining the symptoms of malaria and when a person should go to the doctor and ask for a Rapid Diagnostic Test. After two
minutes the simulation phase is over and the player is presented with a scoreboard. The scoreboard helps highlight what aspects
of the player's strategy was effective and was not. The game is now over, but the player is invited to play again and try to
devise an even more successful defense strategy. Each time the player plays through the game they will have a chance to see more
messages. These facts can be tailored to a specific organization's message or region where the game is distributed. Initially,
the game has been translated into English and Malagasy. However, adding additional languages is as simple as adding the
translations to a text file. You can download the first playable at https://mokaattack.wordpress.com/.

## Motivation
My goal for this project is to create a game that is both fun and educates children about malaria.

## Usage
First you will need to clone the Moka and Trambo repositories. These two directories must live next to each other. The library
files for SFML 2.1 and the source files for TinyXML-2 are already included for you. Now compile Trambo with Visual Studio 2013
followed by Moka. Note: Visual Studio 2015, VC14 broke the C Runtime, so the C external libraries need to be recompiled. Either
use Visual Studio 2013 or use a newer verion of SFML 2.1
